const COMPANY_POLICIES_TEXT = `**AT WILL EMPLOYMENT**

Your employment relationship with the Hotel is 'At-Will' which means that it is a voluntary one which may by be terminated by either the Hotel or yourself, with or without cause, and with or without notice, at any time. Nothing in these policies shall be interpreted to be in conflict with or to eliminate or modify in any way the 'employment-at-will' status of Hotel associates.

**WORKPLACE VIOLENCE PREVENTION POLICY**

The Hotel strives to maintain a productive work environment free of violence and the threat of violence. We are committed to the safety of our associates, vendors, customers and visitors.

The Hotel does not tolerate any type of workplace violence committed by or against associates. Any threats or acts of violence against an associate, vendor customer, visitor or property will not be tolerated. Any associate who threatens violence or acts in a violent manner while on Hotel premises, or during working hours will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Where appropriate, the Hotel will report violent incidents to local law enforcement authorities.

A violent act, or threat of violence, is defined as any direct or indirect action or behavior that could be interpreted, in light of known facts, circumstances and information, by a reasonable person, as indicating the potential for or intent to harm, endanger or inflict pain or injury on any person or property.

Examples of prohibited conduct include but are not limited to:
• Physical assault, threat to assault or stalking an associate or customer;
• Possessing or threatening with a weapon on hotel premises;
• Intentionally damaging property of the Hotel or personal property of another;
• Aggressive or hostile behavior that creates a reasonable fear of injury to another person;
• Harassing or intimidating statements, phone calls, voice mails, or e-mail messages, or those which are unwanted or deemed offensive by the receiver, including cursing and/or name calling;
• Racial or cultural epithets or other derogatory remarks associated with hate crime threats.
• Conduct that threatens, intimidates or coerces another associate, customer, vendor or business associate
• Use of hotel resources to threaten, stalk or harass anyone at the workplace or outside of the workplace.

The Hotel treats threats coming from an abusive personal relationship as it does other forms of violence and associates should promptly inform their immediate supervisor or General Manager of any protective or restraining order that they have obtained that lists the workplace as a protected area.

Any associate who feels threatened or is subjected to violent conduct or who witnesses threatening or violent conduct at the workplace should report the incident to his or her supervisor or any member of management immediately. In addition, associates should report all suspicious individuals or activities as soon as possible.

Associates who are not comfortable reporting incidents at the property level may contact the administrative office at **(908) 444-8139** or via email at **njbackoffice@lakecrest.com**. A representative will promptly and thoroughly investigate all reports of threats or actual violence as well as suspicious individuals and activities at the workplace.

The Hotel will not retaliate against associates making good-faith reports of violence, threats or suspicious individuals or activities.

Anyone determined to be responsible for threats of or actual violence or other conduct that is in violation of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

In order to maintain workplace safety and the integrity of its investigation, the Hotel may suspend associates suspected of workplace violence or threats of violence, either with or without pay, pending investigation.

The Hotel strictly forbids any employee to possess, concealed, or otherwise, any weapon on their person while on the Hotel premises, including but not limited to fire arms. The Hotel also forbids brandishing firearms in the parking lot (other than for lawful self-defense) and prohibiting threats or threatening behavior of any type.

  content: `Your employer (the "Hotel") provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, genetic predisposition, military or veteran status in accordance with applicable federal, state or local laws. This policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including but not limited to, hiring, placement, promotion, termination, transfer, leaves of absence, compensation, and training.`

// Sexual Harassment Policy (requiring initials)
const SEXUAL_HARASSMENT_POLICY = {
  title: 'SEXUAL AND OTHER UNLAWFUL HARASSMENT',
  content: `We are committed to providing a work environment that is free from sexual discrimination and sexual harassment in any form, as well as unlawful harassment based upon any other protected characteristic. In keeping with that commitment, we have established procedures by which allegations of sexual or other unlawful harassment may be reported, investigated and resolved. Each manager and associate has the responsibility to maintain a workplace free of sexual and other unlawful harassment. This duty includes ensuring that associates do not endure insulting, degrading or exploitative sexual treatment.

Sexual harassment is a form of associate misconduct which interferes with work productivity and wrongfully deprives associates of the opportunity to work in an environment free from unsolicited and unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other such verbal or physical conduct. Sexual harassment has many different definitions and it is not the intent of this policy to limit the definition of sexual harassment, but rather to give associates as much guidance as possible concerning what activities may constitute sexual harassment.

Prohibited conduct includes, but is not limited to, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other similar verbal or physical contact of a sexual nature where:
• Submission to such conduct is either an explicit or implicit condition of employment;
• Submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as a basis for making an employment-related decision;
• The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance; or
• The conduct creates a hostile, intimidating or offensive work environment.

Sexual harassment may be male to female, female to male, female to female or male to male. Similarly, other unlawful harassment may be committed by and between individuals who share the same protected characteristics, such as race, age or national origin. Actions which may result in charges of sexual harassment include, but are not limited to, the following:
• Unwelcome physical contact, including touching on any part of the body, kissing, hugging or standing so close as to brush up against another person;
• Requests for sexual favors either directly or indirectly;
• Requiring explicit or implicit sexual conduct as a condition of employment, a condition of obtaining a raise, a condition of obtaining new duties or any type of advancement in the workplace; or
• Requiring an associate to perform certain duties or responsibilities simply because of his or her gender or other protected characteristic.

Other behavior that may seem innocent or acceptable to some people can constitute sexual harassment to others. Prohibited behaviors include, but are not limited to:
• unwelcome sexual flirtations, advances, jokes or propositions;
• unwelcome comments about an individual's body or personal life;
• openly discussing intimate details of one's own personal life;
• sexually degrading words to describe an individual; or
• displays in the workplace of objects, pictures, cartoons or writings, which might be perceived as sexually suggestive.

Unwelcome conduct such as degrading jokes, foul language direct to or at a person, racial slurs, comments, cartoons or writing based upon any other protected characteristic is similarly prohibited.

All associates are required to report any incidents of sexual or other unlawful harassment of which they have knowledge. Similarly, if you ever feel aggrieved because of sexual harassment, you have an obligation to communicate the problem immediately and should report such concerns to your manager, and/or the offending associate directly. If this is not an acceptable option, you should report your concern directly to the administrative office confidentially. In all cases in which a manager or another member of management is notified first, the administrative office should be notified immediately. Management has an obligation to report any suspected violations of this policy to the asset manager. A manager who is aware of a violation, even if the associate is outside the manager's immediate area of supervision, but doesn't report it, will be held accountable for his or her inaction. The asset manager shall conduct a prompt investigation of the allegations to obtain the facts from any and all parties or witnesses.

While we will attempt to maintain the confidentiality of the information received, it will not always be possible to do so. Should the facts support the allegations made, we will remedy the situation and, if appropriate under the circumstances, take disciplinary action up to and including termination.`
